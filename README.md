## Goal
Explore Pewlett Hackard's employee data from the 1980s/1990s

## Overview
I used [QuickDBD](quickdatabasediagrams.com) to draw up a quick [schema](EmployeeSQL/quickdbd-diagram.png) of the data, exported it to create six tables in PostgreSQL, and imported six corresponding CSVs. Ran into many problems at first until we remembered to remove the serial id column during the imports. Then we're able to run our queries.
